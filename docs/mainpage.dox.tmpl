    @section fseventintro fsevent Module Introduction

    The \c fsevent module provides a Qore wrapper around the
    <a href="https://bitbucket.org/SpartanJ/efsw/">Efsw library</a> by Mart√≠n Lucas Golini.

    This module is released under a choice of two licenses:

    - LGPL 2.1
    - MIT (see COPYING.MIT in the source distribution for more information)

    \c fsevent monitors the file system asynchronously for changes to files and directories by
    watching a list of specified paths, and raises events when a directory or file changes.

    It supports watching directories recursively, optionally tracking entire subdirectory trees.

    It currently supports the following platforms:

    - Linux via inotify
    - Windows via I/O Completion Ports
    - MacOS and FreeBSD/BSD via kqueue
    - OS-independent generic watcher (polling the disk for directory snapshots and comparing them periodically)

    If any of the backend fails to start by any reason, it will fallback to the OS-independent implementation

    @section basic_usage Basic usage

    See @ref Qore::FsEvents::AbstractFsWatcher "AbstractFsWatcher" for a full reference including a simple example.

    @section platform_notes Platform Notes

    Windows implementations can't follow symlinks (followSymlinks() and allowOutOfScopeLinks() are ignored).

    The \c kqueue implementation is limited by the maximun number of file descriptors allowed per process by the OS,
    in the case of reaching the file descriptors limit, it will fallback to the generic file watcher.

    The generic watcher relies on the inode information to detect file and directories renames/moves.  Since Windows
    has no concept of inodes, there is no current reliable way of determining file/directory movement on Windows
    without help from the Windows API (this is replaced with Add/Delete events).

    Linux versions below 2.6.13 are not supported, since inotify wasn't implemented yet.

    The OS-independent watcher and Kqueue keep a cache of the directory structures to be able to detect changes in the
    directories. This entails memory overhead for these backends.
